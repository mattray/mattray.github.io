The last [Chef Infra Client 14.15.6]() build has been made available with security fixes before going EOL, so it's time for a final set of 32-bit ARM builds.

# Build Instructions

If you want full instructions explained, here are 15 instructions, it hasn't really changed much:

- [Chef 15 for 32-bit ARM](/2019/05/18/chef-15-on-arm)

**Please note the [ld.so.preload](/2019/09/14/installing-raspbian-10-0-on-a-raspberry-pi) instructions for Raspbian 10.** Here are the updated single scripts to do a full build as the `omnibus` user:

Chef Infra 14.15.6
- CentOS: [RPM-chef-cinc-14.15.6.sh](/assets/RPM-chef-cinc-14.15.6.sh) and run `nohup bash RPM-chef-cinc-14.15.6.sh &`
- Debian/Raspbian/Ubuntu: [DEB-chef-cinc-14.15.6.sh](/assets/DEB-chef-cinc-14.15.6.sh) and run  `nohup bash DEB-chef-cinc-14.15.6.sh &`

And `tail -f nohup.out` to watch the output. The Raspberry Pi Zero is extremely slow to build, you may need to `renice` the build processes to keep it from dying.

# Chef LEDs Handler Cookbook

If you're using these builds you might be interested in the LEDs Handler cookbook. At the beginning of the Chef client run the LEDs blink a heartbeat pattern and at the end of the client run the LEDs are disabled. If the Chef client run fails the LEDs all stay on. It's pretty simple but it's a fun notification that the nodes are converging. It also works with Mac laptops running Linux, lighting up their keyboards when the Chef client is active.
