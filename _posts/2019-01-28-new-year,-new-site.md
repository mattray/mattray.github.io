# A Fresh Start

I've decided to move my infrequent blogging over here to GitHub.
Rather than migrate my existing content, I've decided to leave my former [leastresistance.net site](https://leastresistance.wordpress.com) up and retire it in 2020.

Lots of folks recommended more complex systems, but the pace I post at and the formatting of Markdown was too convenient to pass on.
Time to post more content more frequently.
