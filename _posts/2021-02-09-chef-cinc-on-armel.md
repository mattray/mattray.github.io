[Graham Weldon](https://grahamweldon.com/) has taken the [existing instructions](/arm/) and created new **armel** builds for running on [switches](https://www.edge-core.com/productsInfo.php?cls=1&cls2=9&cls3=46&id=21) and other similar hardware. The build scripts do not require additional patches, but Graham has [documented how to create the builds](https://grahamweldon.com/post/2021/01/building-chef-infra-on-cumulus-linux-armel/). He has graciously allowed me to host his builds, so I'll be including them on the [32-bit Arm Chef Infra and Cinc Client Builds for Linux page](/arm/) going forward.
