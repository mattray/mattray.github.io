This is a minor update from the previous [Chef 14.12 ARM on the BeagleBone/Raspberry Pi](/2019/04/18/chef-14-on-arm) due to a regression in the 14.12.3 release.

# Overview

The [Chef](github.com/chef/chef) client is packaged with [Omnibus](http://github.com/chef/omnibus), which builds the application and all of its runtime dependencies with the [Omnibus-Toolchain](http://github.com/chef/omnibus-toolchain). Omnibus is built with Ruby, so the instructions need to start with building Ruby. These instructions follow the [Installing Debian 9 on a BeagleBone Black](/2019/01/29/installing-debian-9-7-on-a-beaglebone-black) and the [Installing Raspbian 9 on a Raspberry Pi Zero](/2019/01/30/installing-raspbian-9-6-on-a-raspberry-pi-zero), so the Debian machines are ready for use. I have added a new [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) to my home lab, it currently has the same installation instructions as the [Raspberry Pi Zero](/2019/01/30/installing-raspbian-9-6-on-a-raspberry-pi-zero) despite being a 64-bit ARM8 system.

## Preparation

There are several preparatory steps that need to be done before we get started.
As the `root` user update to ensure the latest packages are installed and install the prerequisites for building Ruby and Omnibus-Toolchain.

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install -y autoconf fakeroot git libreadline-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev

Add the `omnibus` user for performing the builds.

    useradd omnibus

### Directories and Permissions

If you have previously-installed Chef and omnibus-toolchain packages (perhaps following these instructions), you'll need to uninstall those and clear out the directories. I'm not `dpkg --purging` them because I want to continue using their Chef configuration once they have the new chef-client installed.

    systemctl stop chef-client
    apt-get remove chef omnibus-toolchain
    rm -rf /opt/chef /opt/omnibus-toolchain

Create and set permissions on the directories used for the upcoming builds.

    mkdir /home/omnibus
    mkdir /var/cache/omnibus
    mkdir /opt/omnibus-toolchain
    mkdir /opt/chef
    chown omnibus:omnibus /home/omnibus
    chown omnibus:omnibus /var/cache/omnibus
    chown omnibus:omnibus /opt/omnibus-toolchain
    chown omnibus:omnibus /opt/chef

## Ruby 2.6.3

The Omnibus-toolchain is built with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby 2.6.3</a>, so as the `omnibus` user we will install it with [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv).

    sudo su - omnibus
    bash

We don't need documentation for our gems.

    echo 'gem: --no-document' >> ~/.gemrc

Let's install `rbenv` and add it to our `PATH`.

    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
    cd ~/.rbenv && src/configure && make -C src
    export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(rbenv init -)"

Install the `ruby-build` plugin to make it easier to manage different Ruby versions.

    mkdir plugins
    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git "$(rbenv root)"/plugins/ruby-build
    rbenv install 2.6.3
    rbenv global 2.6.3
    eval "$(rbenv init -)"

## Omnibus-Toolchain

Now that Ruby is installed, let's build and install the [Omnibus-Toolchain](https://github.com/chef/omnibus-toolchain) as the `omnibus` user.

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/chef/omnibus-toolchain.git
    cd omnibus-toolchain
    bundle install --without development --path=.bundle
    bundle exec omnibus build omnibus-toolchain -l internal

Once this build has completed, as the `root` user remove the working directory and install the new omnibus-toolchain package.

    rm -rf /opt/omnibus-toolchain
    dpkg -i ~omnibus/omnibus-toolchain/pkg/omnibus-toolchain*deb

There is a [bug](https://github.com/chef/omnibus-toolchain/issues/73) in the version of `tar` provided by Omnibus, so let's use Debian's built-in version.

    rm /opt/omnibus-toolchain/bin/tar

## Chef 14.12.9

With `omnibus-toolchain` installed, we can reset our `PATH` and build Chef as the `omnibus` user.

    cd
    export PATH="/opt/omnibus-toolchain/bin:$PATH"
    wget https://github.com/chef/chef/archive/v14.12.9.tar.gz
    tar -xzf v14.12.9.tar.gz
    cd chef-14.12.9/omnibus/
    bundle install --without development --path=.bundle
    bundle exec omnibus build chef -l internal

This usually takes several hours on these limited 32-bit ARM machines.

# Installing Chef 14.12.9

Once the builds have completed, as the `root` user we can delete the working build directory.

    rm -rf /opt/chef

Now Chef 14.12.9 can be installed.

    dpkg -i /home/omnibus/chef-14.12.9/omnibus/pkg/chef_14.12.9*arm*.deb

## Using the new Chef build

From your workstation, you can now `knife bootstrap` the machine with the ARM build on it and register it with your Chef Server. If you are working with a previously Chef-managed box, you can run `chef-client` and the machine will continue to use its previous configuration.
