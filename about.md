I'm Matt Ray, an Open Source geek and one of the co-hosts of the [Software Defined Talk](https://www.softwaredefinedtalk.com) podcast. I currently live in Sydney, Australia and like hacking on broken or odd devices and sharing what I've learned.

Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mattray), [GitHub](http://github.com/mattray/), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhray/) if it's work-related.
