title: 32-bit Arm Chef Infra and Cinc Client Builds for Linux
permalink: /arm/
---

I've done builds of Chef and Cinc for 32-bit Arm systems (Raspberry Pi and similar) for awhile, so I figured I'd create a landing page for them. You may download the builds I've made or follow the instructions to make your own. Now that I no longer work for Chef, I won't be making Chef builds going forward but you're welcome to create your own. I've also stopped building RPMs, so the only new builds I'm providing are Raspbian 10 armv6l and Debian 11 armv7l.

[Graham Weldon](https://grahamweldon.com/) has taken these instructions and created new **armel** builds for running on [switches](https://www.edge-core.com/productsInfo.php?cls=1&cls2=9&cls3=46&id=21) and other similar hardware. The build scripts do not require additional patches, but Graham has [documented how to create the builds](https://grahamweldon.com/post/2021/01/building-chef-infra-on-cumulus-linux-armel/). Copies of the builds will be hosted here going forward.

# Latest Builds

The 32-bit Arm build targets are Debian/Raspbian/Ubuntu on the `armv6l` (Raspberry Pi 1/Zero series) and `armv7hl` (Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 series). CentOS 7 RPMs are also provided for the `armv7hl`. Previous releases of the builds and their instructions are available [here](/old-arm/).

# Building with Omnibus

The [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef) client is packaged with [Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus), which builds the application and all of its runtime dependencies with the [Omnibus-Toolchain](https://github.com/chef/omnibus-toolchain). Omnibus is built with Ruby, so the instructions start with building Ruby. These instructions assume you have already installed either [Debian 9](/2019/01/29/installing-debian-9-7-on-a-beaglebone-black), [Raspbian 10](/2019/09/14/installing-raspbian-10-0-on-a-raspberry-pi), or [CentOS 7](/2019/05/07/installing-centos-7-6-on-a-raspberry-pi-three) on your system already.

## Preparation

There are several steps that need to be done before we get started. As the `root` user update to ensure the latest packages are installed and install the prerequisites for building Ruby and Omnibus-Toolchain.

For CentOS:

    yum update
    yum install -y autoconf automake bison flex gcc gcc-c++ gdbm-devel gettext git kernel-devel libffi-devel libyaml-devel m4 make ncurses-devel openssl-devel patch readline-devel rpm-build wget zlib-devel

For Debian/Raspbian:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install -y autoconf build-essential byacc fakeroot git libreadline-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev

## ld.so.preload

Raspbian sets the file `/etc/ld.so.preload` to

    /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libarmmem-${PLATFORM}.so

in an attempt to support both the 6l and 7l armhf platforms. This breaks the Chef 32-bit Arm builds on Raspbian so I have replaced this line with

    echo /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libarmmem-v7l.so > /etc/ld.so.preload

on the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 and

    echo /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libarmmem-v6l.so > /etc/ld.so.preload

on the Raspberry Pi Zero.

## Omnibus User

Add the `omnibus` user for performing the builds.

    adduser omnibus

Ensure the `omnibus` user has `sudo` privileges and add the following file to `/etc/sudoers.d/omnibus`. Feel free to use the `wheel` group or more limited permissions as necessary.

    omnibus  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

You can now `sudo su - omnibus` and continue without changing users.


# Build Scripts

If you want detailed instructions for the steps for building on these platforms check out [Chef 15 Build Instructions for 32-bit Arm](/2019/05/18/chef-15-on-arm). The build is currently Ruby 2.7.3 and does not require any additional patches. To build a specific version, you provide an environment variable `VERSION` before executing the script. I typically run them as the `omnibus` user with something similar to `VERSION=17.3.48 nohup bash RPM-chef-cinc.sh &` and `tail -f nohup.out` to monitor the output.

DEB Build Script: [DEB-chef-cinc.sh](/assets/DEB-chef-cinc.sh)

RPM Build Script: [RPM-chef-cinc.sh](/assets/RPM-chef-cinc.sh)

Build scripts for previous releases are available [here](/old-arm/).

# Additional Notes

## GPU Memory Usage

Because my systems are used primarily has headless servers, I've configured them to use less GPU memory by setting

    gpu_mem=16

in the `/boot/config.txt`. I do this in the [mattray::raspberrypi](https://github.com/mattray/mattray-cookbook/blob/master/recipes/raspberrypi.rb#L59) recipe used by all of my Raspbian systems.

## Chef LEDs Handler Cookbook

If you're using these builds you might be interested in the LEDs Handler cookbook. At the beginning of the Chef client run the LEDs blink a heartbeat pattern and at the end of the client run the LEDs are disabled. If the Chef client run fails the LEDs all stay on. It's pretty simple but it's a fun notification that the nodes are converging. It also works with Mac laptops running Linux, lighting up their keyboards when the Chef client is active.
